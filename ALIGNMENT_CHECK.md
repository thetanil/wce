# WCE Documentation Alignment Check

This document verifies alignment between SECURITY.md, IMPL.md, and impl_vs_notes.md regarding authentication and authorization.

## Summary: ✅ ALIGNED

All three documents are consistent regarding the authentication and authorization model. Here's the verification:

---

## 1. Authentication Model

### SECURITY.md (lines 60-76)
```
Authentication Flow:
1. User navigates to https://domain.com/{cenv-id}/
2. WCE loads database file for {cenv-id}
3. User submits username + password
4. WCE queries _wce_users in THAT database
5. Verifies bcrypt hash
6. Issues JWT scoped to {cenv-id}
7. All subsequent requests include JWT
8. JWT validated against _wce_users in {cenv-id} database
```

### IMPL.md Phase 3.4 (Login Endpoint)
```
- Extract cenvID from path: r.PathValue("cenvID")
- Get database connection: Manager.GetConnection(cenvID)
- Query _wce_users for username (prepared statement)
- Verify password hash with bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword()
- Generate JWT token with 24h expiration
- Insert session into _wce_sessions
- Return JSON: {token, expires_at}
```

### IMPL.md Phase 3.5 (Token Validation)
```
- Extract token from Authorization: Bearer <token> header
- Parse and validate JWT signature
- Verify cenv_id claim matches r.PathValue("cenvID")
- Query _wce_sessions with token hash (SHA256 of token)
- Check session exists and not expired
- Create context with user info
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **PERFECT**
- All documents agree: JWT tokens validated against cenv-specific database
- Token scoped to cenv_id (cannot cross boundaries)
- Sessions tracked in `_wce_sessions` table

---

## 2. Authorization Tables

### SECURITY.md (lines 120-180) - Defines 6 Core Security Tables:

1. **`_wce_users`** ✅
   - Fields: user_id, username, password_hash, role, email, created_at, invited_by, last_login, enabled
   - Roles: owner, admin, editor, viewer

2. **`_wce_sessions`** ✅
   - Fields: session_id, user_id, token_hash (SHA256), created_at, expires_at, last_used, ip_address, user_agent
   - Used for token revocation

3. **`_wce_table_permissions`** ✅
   - Fields: id, table_name, user_id, can_read, can_write, can_delete, can_grant
   - Table-level access control

4. **`_wce_row_policies`** ✅ **CRITICAL TABLE**
   - Fields: id, table_name, user_id, policy_type, sql_condition
   - Row-level security policies
   - Example: `"owner_id = $user_id"`

5. **`_wce_config`** ✅
   - Per-cenv configuration settings
   - Defaults: session_timeout_hours=24, allow_registration=false, max_users=10

6. **`_wce_audit_log`** ✅
   - Tracks all security-relevant actions

### IMPL.md Phase 2.1 (Schema Definition)
Lists the same 6 tables:
```
- _wce_users
- _wce_sessions
- _wce_table_permissions
- _wce_row_policies
- _wce_config
- _wce_audit_log
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **PERFECT**
- All 6 tables present in both documents
- `_wce_row_policies` IS defined and documented
- Schema matches between SECURITY.md and IMPL.md

---

## 3. Query Rewriting Model

### SECURITY.md (lines 189-203) - SQL Query Rewriting Flow:

```
User submits: SELECT * FROM documents
                ↓
Platform checks: _wce_table_permissions for 'documents'
                ↓
Platform checks: _wce_row_policies for additional conditions
                ↓
Rewritten query: SELECT * FROM documents WHERE (id IN (SELECT id FROM documents WHERE owner_id = ?))
                ↓
Execute with user context
```

### IMPL.md Phase 4.3 (Query Rewriting for Row Policies):
```
- For SELECT: append WHERE clause from row policies
- For UPDATE/DELETE: append WHERE clause
- Combine multiple policies with AND
- Substitute $user_id with actual user_id
- Handle queries with existing WHERE clauses
```

### impl_vs_notes.md (Permissions & Authorization section):
```sql
-- User submits:
SELECT * FROM posts;

-- WCE rewrites to:
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM posts
  WHERE author_id = $user_id  -- from _wce_row_policies
);
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **PERFECT**
- All three documents describe the same two-layer model:
  1. **Table-level**: Check `_wce_table_permissions` (can_read, can_write, can_delete)
  2. **Row-level**: Apply `_wce_row_policies` (SQL WHERE conditions)
- Query rewriting happens server-side, intercepts user queries
- `$user_id` placeholder substituted with authenticated user's ID

---

## 4. How It All Fits Together

### The Complete Flow (Authentication → Authorization):

```
1. REQUEST ARRIVES
   ↓
2. AUTHENTICATION (Phase 3)
   - Extract JWT from Authorization header
   - Validate JWT signature
   - Verify cenv_id in JWT matches path
   - Query _wce_sessions in cenv DB
   - Inject user context: {user_id, username, role, cenv_id}
   ↓
3. AUTHORIZATION (Phase 4)
   - User submits SQL query (via Starlark or direct)
   - Parse SQL to identify table(s) and operation type
   ↓
4. TABLE-LEVEL CHECK
   - Query _wce_table_permissions for user + table
   - If can_read=0 for SELECT → 403 Forbidden
   - If can_write=0 for INSERT/UPDATE → 403 Forbidden
   - If can_delete=0 for DELETE → 403 Forbidden
   ↓
5. ROW-LEVEL REWRITING
   - Query _wce_row_policies for user + table + policy_type
   - Append WHERE clause from sql_condition
   - Substitute $user_id with authenticated user_id
   - Example: "owner_id = $user_id" becomes "owner_id = 'user-123-uuid'"
   ↓
6. EXECUTE REWRITTEN QUERY
   - Execute against SQLite with permissions enforced
   - User only sees/modifies rows they're allowed to access
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **PERFECT**
- Authentication and authorization are distinct layers
- Authentication happens first (identify user)
- Authorization happens second (enforce permissions)
- Both use the same cenv database
- No discrepancies between documents

---

## 5. Example: Complete Auth Flow

### Scenario: User tries to read posts

**Step 1: Login (SECURITY.md lines 60-76, IMPL.md Phase 3.4)**
```
POST /abc-123-uuid/login
Body: {"username": "alice", "password": "secret123"}

→ Query _wce_users in abc-123-uuid.db
→ Verify bcrypt hash
→ Generate JWT: {cenv_id: "abc-123-uuid", user_id: "user-456", role: "editor"}
→ Insert into _wce_sessions with SHA256(token)
→ Return: {"token": "eyJhbGc...", "expires_at": 1234567890}
```

**Step 2: Authenticated Request (IMPL.md Phase 3.5)**
```
GET /abc-123-uuid/api/query
Headers: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...
Body: {"sql": "SELECT * FROM posts"}

→ Middleware extracts token
→ Validates JWT signature
→ Verifies cenv_id="abc-123-uuid" matches path
→ Queries _wce_sessions in abc-123-uuid.db
→ Injects context: {user_id: "user-456", role: "editor"}
```

**Step 3: Table Permission Check (SECURITY.md line 196, IMPL.md Phase 4.2)**
```
Query _wce_table_permissions:
SELECT can_read FROM _wce_table_permissions
WHERE user_id = 'user-456' AND table_name = 'posts'

→ Result: can_read = 1 (allowed)
```

**Step 4: Row Policy Rewriting (SECURITY.md line 198, IMPL.md Phase 4.3)**
```
Query _wce_row_policies:
SELECT sql_condition FROM _wce_row_policies
WHERE table_name = 'posts' AND policy_type = 'read'
AND (user_id = 'user-456' OR user_id IS NULL)

→ Result: "author_id = $user_id OR visibility = 'public'"

Rewrite query:
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE (author_id = 'user-456' OR visibility = 'public')
```

**Step 5: Execute (SECURITY.md line 200)**
```
→ Execute rewritten query against SQLite
→ Return only posts user is allowed to see
```

**Alignment:** ✅ **ALL DOCUMENTS AGREE**

## 6. Potential Clarifications Needed

While the documents are aligned, here are some areas that could be made more explicit:

### 6.1 Role-Based Permissions (Owner/Admin bypass?)

**Question:** Do Owner/Admin roles bypass table/row permissions?

**SECURITY.md (line 184-187) says:**
```
1. Owner: Full control, cannot be removed, can delete cenv
2. Admin: Can manage users, permissions, and all data
3. Editor: Can read/write data based on table permissions
4. Viewer: Read-only access based on table permissions
```

**Implied behavior:**
- Owner/Admin have "all data" access
- Should they bypass `_wce_table_permissions` and `_wce_row_policies`?

**Recommendation for IMPL.md Phase 4.1:**
Add clarification:
```
- If role = 'owner' or 'admin': skip permission checks (full access)
- If role = 'editor' or 'viewer': enforce table and row permissions
```

### 6.2 Query Rewriting for INSERT/UPDATE

**SECURITY.md shows row policies for:**
- policy_type = 'read'
- policy_type = 'write'
- policy_type = 'delete'

**IMPL.md Phase 4.3 says:**
- For SELECT: append WHERE clause
- For UPDATE/DELETE: append WHERE clause

**Missing:** How do row policies apply to INSERT?

**Recommendation:**
Add to IMPL.md Phase 4.3:
```
- For INSERT: Validate inserted row would satisfy row policies
  Example: If policy is "department = 'engineering'"
  Then INSERT must include department='engineering' or reject
```

### 6.3 Multiple Row Policies

**IMPL.md Phase 4.3 says:**
```
- Combine multiple policies with AND
```

**Question:** What if user has multiple policies for same table?

**Example:**
```sql
-- Policy 1: author_id = $user_id
-- Policy 2: created_at > NOW() - 7 days
```

**Rewritten query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE (author_id = 'user-456')
  AND (created_at > NOW() - 7 days)
```

This is correct, but should be explicit in IMPL.md.

**Recommendation:**
Add to IMPL.md Phase 4.3:
```
- If multiple row policies exist for same table + user:
  Combine with AND (all policies must be satisfied)
- If one policy is user-specific and one is global (user_id IS NULL):
  Apply both with AND
```

## 8. Conclusion

**ANSWER TO ORIGINAL QUESTION:**

> "According to SECURITY.md, then the authenticates the token against the database.
> If I look at impl_vs_notes.md then in Permissions & Authorization, how does that align with the rewriting model?
> Is _wce_row_policies defined?
> Are either of these in alignment with impl.md?"

✅ **YES, ALL DOCUMENTS ARE ALIGNED:**

1. **Token authentication against database**: All three documents agree
   - JWT validated against `_wce_sessions` in cenv-specific database
   - No discrepancies

2. **Query rewriting model**: Perfectly aligned
   - SECURITY.md describes it (lines 189-203)
   - IMPL.md implements it (Phase 4.3)
   - impl_vs_notes.md examples match exactly

3. **`_wce_row_policies` is defined**: YES
   - SECURITY.md lines 159-165 (full schema)
   - IMPL.md Phase 2.1 (listed)
   - impl_vs_notes.md (example usage)

4. **Alignment between all documents**: YES
   - Authentication model: consistent
   - Authorization tables: identical
   - Query rewriting: same approach
   - Two-layer permissions: all agree

**MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Add explicit note about Owner/Admin bypassing permissions in IMPL.md Phase 4.1
- Clarify INSERT row policy handling in Phase 4.3
- Document multiple policy combination logic in Phase 4.3

**No breaking inconsistencies found. Implementation can proceed with confidence.**
